# Rallis Timber Website rebuild
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: 
The original website is the one my family use for their business and it is quite lacking in my views and overcomplicatedm, my goals are to build it from scratch and incorporate aesthetics that i like and feel would better the user experience of the website but not drift too far away from the original.

[Rallis Timber]( http://www.rallistimber.com.au/) is the original website.

The website will be built using [Bootstrap v5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) for the frontend and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/) serving the website.

## MVP
The MVP will be to have a website with all the pages and information as expected in basic formatting.

## Goals
Some aspects of websites that would be nice to have are:
- a much better page navigation system compared to the original
- condense the navigation list as there are way too many pages to be useful
- have a nice side bar quote menu
- find a nice way to render the website design wise
- thumbnails to click on
- file submission insight (a little out of scope, button there working no backend)
