        <h6>We are able to order all sizes of Treated Pine and have stock available for purchase</h6>
        <p>Treated pine is a timber that has been treated with chemical solutions containing both fungicide and insecticides, which aims to provide long-term resistance to decay and insects. The treatment is an effective protection which makes the treated pine durable even in applications where it is exposed to the elements.</p>
